This notebook addresses a highly sophisticated energy optimization problem by incorporating complex, non-linear objective functions and constraints. We aim to:

Minimize operational energy costs.
Ensure comfort and efficiency constraints are met.
Visualize results with advanced plots for deeper insights.
